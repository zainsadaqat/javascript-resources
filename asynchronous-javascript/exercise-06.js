/*
6. Debouncing User Input
Scenario: You're building a search bar where users can type a query, but the app should only fetch results after they stop typing (to avoid unnecessary API calls).

Task:

Create a debounce function that delays API calls by 500ms after the user stops typing.
Use it to simulate fetching search results when a user types in a search bar.
