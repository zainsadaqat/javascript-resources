# Asynchronous JavaScript

Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to do multiple tasks at the same time without blocking the main program.

For Example: Imagine you're at a coffee shop

- You order coffee (a task)
- The barista starts making your coffee, but instead of waiting for it, you move to a table and start reading a book (doing another task).
- When the coffee is ready, the barista calls you, and you collect it.

In this scenario:

- Ordering coffee is like making a request in your program.
- Reading a book while waiting is like running other code while the asynchronous task is being processed.
- Getting the coffee when ready is like handling the result of the asynchronous task.
