Exercise 5: Dynamic Theme Switcher
Scenario: You are adding a theme switcher to a website. 

Users should:

a) Toggle between light and dark mode.
b) Save their preference in localStorage so it persists across page reloads.

Requirements:
Add a "Toggle Theme" button to switch between light and dark mode.
Apply a "dark-mode" class to the <body> when dark mode is active.
Check localStorage when the page loads to apply the saved theme.
