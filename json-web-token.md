# JSON Web Token (JWT)

## What is JWT?

A JSON Web Token is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It’s often used for authentication. After a successful login, the server issues a JWT, which the client then stores (for example, in localStorage) and sends with every subsequent request to prove that it’s authenticated.
