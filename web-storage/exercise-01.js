/* 
To-Do List App

Objective: Learn to store, retrieve, and delete an array of tasks in local storage.

Instructions: Create a simple to-do list app where users can:

a) Add a new task.
b) Mark tasks as completed.
c) Remove tasks.

Steps:

- Save the list of tasks in local storage as an array.
- Use JSON.stringify() when storing the array and JSON.parse() when retrieving it.
- On page load, display the tasks saved in local storage.
- Provide a "Clear All Tasks" button to reset the storage.

Example User Flow:
A user adds tasks: "Buy groceries" and "Complete homework."
They refresh the page, and the tasks still appear.
They mark "Buy groceries" as completed, and the updated state is saved.
