/*
Theme Switcher with Persistent State

Objective: Use local storage to save and retrieve a user's theme preference.

Instructions:

a) Create a simple webpage with a light mode and a dark mode.
b) Add a button to toggle between light and dark themes.
c) Save the selected theme to local storage so that it persists across page refreshes.

On page load:
- Check local storage for the theme preference.
- Apply the saved theme.

Example User Flow:
The user toggles to dark mode, refreshes the page, and the dark mode remains active.
They switch back to light mode, and it persists after a page reload.

Tips:
Store the theme as a string, e.g., "light" or "dark".
Use the classList API for toggling CSS classes.
