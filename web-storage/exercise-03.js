Login Reminder Feature
Objective: Create a system to store a user's login information (username only, no passwords) in local storage.

Instructions:
a) Create a form with an input field for the username and a "Remember Me" checkbox.
b) When the "Remember Me" checkbox is checked:
c) Save the username to local storage.
d) Pre-fill the username field with the saved value when the page loads.

e) If the checkbox is unchecked: Clear the saved username from local storage.

Example User Flow:
The user enters "JohnDoe" and checks "Remember Me."
After refreshing the page, the username field is pre-filled with "JohnDoe."

They uncheck the box and refresh; the field is now empty.

Bonus:
Add a Reset button to clear the username and uncheck the checkbox.
